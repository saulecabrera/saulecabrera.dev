#### 2021-05-25

- Hacked on [brilhs](https://github.com/saulecabrera/brilhs). Moving forward I need to
  restructure the instruction data constructors to better reflect the real
  definition.

- Hacked / experimented with wasmtime. Mostly writing some benchmarks and
  trying to figure out how [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs)
  decides how many iterations are ideal for each bench.

- Hacked on a side project that I'm working on related to [Crafting IDE-Ready
  Compilers](https://dev.to/cad97/crafting-ide-ready-compilers-500o). I'm
  mostly interested in the static analysis side of this subject.
