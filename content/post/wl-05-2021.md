#### 2021-05-25

- Hacked on [brilhs](https://github.com/saulecabrera/brilhs). Moving forward I need to
  restructure the instruction data constructors to better reflect the real
  definition.

- Hacked / experimented with wasmtime. Mostly writing some benchmarks and
  trying to figure out how [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs)
  decides how many iterations are ideal for each bench.

- Hacked on a side project that I'm working on related to [Crafting IDE-Ready
  Compilers](https://dev.to/cad97/crafting-ide-ready-compilers-500o). I'm
  mostly interested in the static analysis side of this subject.

- Hacked a bit more on [Bril](https://github.com/saulecabrera/brilhs). I'm
  happy with the way I have defined the data constructors for each instruction.
  Next steps:
    - Create a `fromJSON` function to load programs from their canonical JSON
      representation.
    - Create a `toJSON` function to convert programs to their canonical JSON
      representation.
    - Create a `toText` function to convert programs to their textual
      representation. (This is probably mostly a nice to have)

- Hacked on brilhs; focused on implementing
  [Aeson's](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-1.5.6.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html#g:1) `FromJSON` for
  `Program`. I've used Aeson lightly in the past and didn't realize until now
  that making use of Haskell's pattern matching, it's the right way to define `parseJSON`
  for a type when it can be constructed from several JSON values:

  ```haskell
  instance FromJSON MyType where

    parseJSON (Strint s) =
      ...

    parseJSON (Object o) =
      ...
  ```
